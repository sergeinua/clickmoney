                <p>By clicking on "Continue", you are giving us permission to send you emails about our offers. If you chose not to receive any more emails, you can always opt out at any time at the bottom of each email. </p>

                <p>clickmoneymembersaccess respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which clickmoneymembersaccess protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by clickmoneymembersaccess, including clickmoneymembersaccess and clickmoneymembersaccess. This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information. </p>

                <p>
                    <b>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</b><br>
                    clickmoneymembersaccess typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to clickmoneymembersaccess through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want clickmoneymembersaccess to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that clickmoneymembersaccess not use your information by sending an e-mail to: <u>support@clickmoneymembersaccess</u> , however, clickmoneymembersaccess reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your clickmoneymembersaccess services. Absent any instructions from you, clickmoneymembersaccess may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the clickmoneymembersaccess family of companies, clickmoneymembersaccess authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom clickmoneymembersaccess has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. clickmoneymembersaccess will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those clickmoneymembersaccess sites where you may provide clickmoneymembersaccess with credit card or other ordering information via the web, clickmoneymembersaccess protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, clickmoneymembersaccess will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, clickmoneymembersaccess assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

                    <b>B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:</b><br>
                    In general, clickmoneymembersaccess gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the clickmoneymembersaccess sites visited. clickmoneymembersaccess gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about clickmoneymembersaccess services). clickmoneymembersaccess does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
